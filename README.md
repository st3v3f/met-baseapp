# met-baseapp

A nice starting point for my MeteorJS applications.

Extension and adaptation of the great
[Differential/meteor-boilerplate](https://github.com/Differential/meteor-boilerplate)
repo.

[Work in progress]

My additions:
* Register with username and email, sign in with either.
* Simple connection status icon added to navbar.
* Dashboard link on navbar only shown on login.
* Removed header capitalisation from css.
